# StateAxis seven-mod historical performance screen

This page registers the existing seven-carrier performance screen without
changing its identity or qualification. It is **not** a Qwen3.5-35B or AgentX
result.

The original campaign used Qwen3.8-27B, TP4, eager execution, physical Ascend
910B2 NPU4--7 and `stateaxis/runtime:dev42-cann91`. It compared each active
carrier against ECPA-off dev42 in the same runtime. The control was not an
untouched `0.3.0.base1` build. Each value is one matched service observation,
so none is performance-qualified.

| Historical carrier | Median request wall time | Change from ECPA-off dev42 | Classification |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `stateaxis.state-feedback-plane` | 3.657639 s | -1.06% | promising single run; unqualified |
| `stateaxis.ascend-state-action` | 3.827980 s | +3.55% | negative; fallback-only |
| `stateaxis.hybrid-branch-coherence` | 4.940114 s | +1.41% | negative |
| `stateaxis.no-harm-preparation` | 4.978619 s | +2.20% | negative safety mechanism |
| `stateaxis.dependency-invalidation` | 5.448510 s | +1.00% | negative safety mechanism |
| `stateaxis.workflow-state-scheduling` | 3.768619 s | +1.94% | negative policy mechanism |
| `stateaxis.hybrid-hibernation` | 3.999750 s | +8.20% | negative lifecycle mechanism |

Lower wall time is better. The feedback result is a single observation without
cross-service repetition. All other request paths were slower or fallback-only.
Failed `invalid-port-custody` attempts remain preserved in the source record and
support no claim.

The campaign belonged to the aggregate repository at
`f4e4a87bb56b553961adee5aab6e6d0ba588071c`. The seven current independent
`Qixin-Gaoke/stateaxis-*` repositories do not inherit its functional, device or
performance qualification. The machine-readable record maps each historical
identity to its current repository solely for provenance.

See [`data/stateaxis-seven-mod-historical.json`](../data/stateaxis-seven-mod-historical.json)
for effect receipts, fixed commits, archive digests and the pending Qwen3.5 +
AgentX follow-up contract. A future Qwen3.5/AgentX matrix must use a fresh
matched control, the independently pinned repositories, repeated ordering,
exactness, effect attribution, process release and device release. These
historical values must not be inserted into the Qwen3.5 Frontier curve.

## Qwen3.5 + AgentX follow-up preflight

The 2026-09-28 follow-up found four visible idle Ascend 910B2 devices and
verified all 22 Qwen3.5 model files against the published SHA-256/size manifest.
The pinned AgentX wrapper passed 18 tests and the StateAxis source import exposed
all seven identities. No server or device workload was started.

The official dataset loader could not resolve the exact public corpus revision
after exhausting TLS EOF retries, and no prepared cache was present. The pod's
default vLLM metadata was also 0.23.0 rather than a frozen dev43 runtime image.
The run therefore stopped before serving. No mirror, alternate revision,
subset, synthetic workload or old metric was substituted. See the
[machine-readable preflight receipt](../data/stateaxis-qwen35-agentx-followup.json).
